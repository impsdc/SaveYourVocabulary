# SaveYourVocabulary is an App to improve your vocabulary

## How does it work ?

Basically after creating your account, you will be able to search for any words to find his definitions, synonyms and sentence exemple with [dictionaryapi](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and save these data to your personal account.
Finnaly, there will be a test area where you will be capable to guess the word by his definition.

## Technologies used

Apart my ambition to improve my vocabulary I'm doing this project also to refine my Typescript skills.

On front-End
    - [Typescript React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) with [Redux store](https://redux.js.org/api/store)
    - [ReflexBox](https://github.com/jxnblk/reflexbox) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) templating and styling

On Back-End
    - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) api
